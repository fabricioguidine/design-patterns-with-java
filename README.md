## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns (5)

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

| Pattern | Description | Link |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Abstract Factory** | Provides an interface for creating families of related objects | [View](design-patterns/creational/abstractFactory) |
| **Builder** | Constructs complex objects step by step | [View](design-patterns/creational/builder) |
| **Factory Method** | Creates objects without specifying the exact class | [View](design-patterns/creational/factoryMethod) |
| **Prototype** | Creates objects by cloning existing instances | [View](design-patterns/creational/prototype) |
| **Singleton** | Ensures a class has only one instance | [View](design-patterns/creational/singleton) |

### Structural Patterns (7)

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

| Pattern | Description | Link |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Adapter** | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together | [View](design-patterns/structural/adapter) |
| **Bridge** | Separates abstraction from implementation | [View](design-patterns/structural/bridge) |
| **Composite** | Composes objects into tree structures | [View](design-patterns/structural/composite) |
| **Decorator** | Adds behavior to objects dynamically | [View](design-patterns/structural/decorator) |
| **Facade** | Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem | [View](design-patterns/structural/facade) |
| **Flyweight** | Shares state to support large numbers of fine-grained objects | [View](design-patterns/structural/flyweight) |
| **Proxy** | Provides a placeholder for another object | [View](design-patterns/structural/proxy) |

### Behavioral Patterns (11)

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

| Pattern | Description | Link |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes requests along a chain of handlers | [View](design-patterns/behavioral/chainOfResponsibility) |
| **Command** | Encapsulates requests as objects | [View](design-patterns/behavioral/command) |
| **Interpreter** | Defines a representation for grammar and an interpreter | [View](design-patterns/behavioral/interpreter) |
| **Iterator** | Provides a way to access elements of a collection | [View](design-patterns/behavioral/iterator) |
| **Mediator** | Defines how objects interact with each other | [View](design-patterns/behavioral/mediator) |
| **Memento** | Captures and restores an object's internal state | [View](design-patterns/behavioral/memento) |
| **Observer** | Notifies multiple objects about state changes | [View](design-patterns/behavioral/observer) |
| **State** | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes | [View](design-patterns/behavioral/state) |
| **Strategy** | Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable | [View](design-patterns/behavioral/strategy) |
| **Template Method** | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm | [View](design-patterns/behavioral/templateMethod) |

## Building and Testing

### Build All Patterns

To build all design patterns at once:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This will compile all patterns, run all tests, and package the artifacts.

### Build Individual Pattern

Navigate to a specific pattern directory and build:

```bash
cd design-patterns/creational/abstractFactory
mvn clean install
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

### Run Tests for Specific Pattern

```bash
cd design-patterns/creational/singleton
mvn test
```

### Run Specific Test Class

```bash
cd design-patterns/creational/abstractFactory
mvn test -Dtest=EmployeeTest
```

### Build Without Tests

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Each pattern follows a standard Maven project structure:

```
<pattern-name>/
├── pom.xml                    # Maven project configuration

```

## Usage Examples

### Abstract Factory Pattern

```java
// Create a factory for internal employees
AbstractFactory factory = new InternalEmployeeFactory();
Employee employee = new Employee(factory);

// Generate payroll and report
String payroll = employee.generatePayroll();
String report = employee.generateReport();
```

### Singleton Pattern

```java
// Get the singleton instance
DatabaseConnection connection = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();
connection.connect("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb", "user", "password");
```

### Strategy Pattern

```java
// Create a user with different file format strategies
User user = new User();
String result = user.savePDF("document.pdf");
String result2 = user.saveXML("data.xml");
```

### Builder Pattern

```java
// Build a motorcycle step by step
Motorcycle motorcycle = new MotorcycleBuilder()
    .setBrand("Honda")
    .setModel("CBR")

    .setColor("Red")
    .setPrice(15000.0f)
    .build();
```

## Pattern Categories

### Creational Patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**Key Patterns:**
- **Abstract Factory**: Create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
- **Builder**: Construct complex objects step by step with validation
- **Factory Method**: Delegate object creation to subclasses
- **Prototype**: Clone objects for creation instead of creating new instances
- **Singleton**: Ensure a class has only one instance with global access
